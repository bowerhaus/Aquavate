# Aquavate - Active Development Progress

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-13 (USB Time Setting Complete & Tested)

---

## Current Branch: `usb-time-setting`

**Status:** Ready to merge to master

All standalone device features complete:
- Two-point calibration system (empty + full 830ml bottle)
- Gesture-based calibration trigger (inverted hold for 5s)
- Real-time water level measurement and display (±10-15ml accuracy)
- USB time configuration via serial commands (SET_TIME, GET_TIME, SET_TIMEZONE)
- Smart e-paper display refresh (only updates when water level changes ≥5ml)
- NVS storage for calibration data, timezone, and time_valid flag
- ESP32 internal RTC (no external DS3231 needed)

Hardware testing complete. Documentation updated. Code refactored.
